A Developer Helper Cli ToolðŸ¤”

Before, I've written a cli tool for background developement for Nuco.Tech, called [nbc](https://open.nuco.tech/nuco-backend-cli/). It supports multi-platforms and really helps me with developing.

But, maybe I need a new cli tool for me with frontend development.

## Features

- [x] support commit message in emoji style
- [x] detect the local developing environment

## Usage

```bash
# install as global dependence
npm install -g developer-helper-cli

# run `dhc help` command in terminal for help
dhc help
```

## Commands

See the source code [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) directly is recommended.
